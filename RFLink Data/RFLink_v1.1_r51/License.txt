The RFLink distributed and pre-compiled code is made available free of charge and without any warranties.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.
If someone made you pay for this program, contact us!


The RFLink Gateway Source Code is made available so that third parties can develop their own plugins for the RFLink Gateway.
Availability of the core code and functional sample plugins does not mean that each and every plugin will be open source.
The fact that the code is published does not mean you obtain any kind of ownership or get any rights to the code.
This License explicitly affirms that you have the right to use the source code as a development environment to create your 
own plugins which you can share with the community and project maintainers. 
When you publish your plugin with the community it automatically falls under this license. However, it is also possible to share your 
plugin with the project maintainers and keep your plugin closed source. In that case, the compiled portions of your code will 
automatically fall under this license. All contributors hold the copyright for their own work.
The source code is free for use in any open source project when the original copyright notices, headers and this license file are included. 
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it when the original copyright notices and headers are included. 

You are not allowed to sell the pre-compiled code or the source code or distribute it without this license file. 

Usage of any parts of this code in a commercial work is prohibited unless express written approval is granted!
Some parts of the code might contain watermarking to identify our work.
You are not allowed to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any parts of the pre-compiled program.

The license does not permit incorporating this program into proprietary programs.

Warning: 
The RFLink Gateway should not be used in any life-threatening situations. 

The RFLink Gateway is NOT justified to be used as a main part of a primary alarm system. 
RFLink may only be used to listen to alarm sensors or activate a siren to complement a home automation system.
Note that if you own an alarm system which RFLink could disarm by broadcasting a recorded signal, it is time to upgrade your alarm system.
